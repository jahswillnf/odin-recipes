    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This a different potato salad for those who don't want a mayonnaise-based recipe. My family has enjoyed this for many years, and it is easy to adapt by adding more spices that suit your family. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 white potatoes, peeled and cut into cubes </li>
        <li>1 large Onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>¼ cup cider vinegar, divided </li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper </li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until just tender, about 15 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Put potatoes into a large bowl; add onion and stir.</li>
        <li>Mix sugar, mustard, and salt together in a bowl. Stir just enough vinegar into the sugar mixture to form a paste; season with black pepper.</li>
        <li>Whisk remaining vinegar and vegetable oil together in a separate bowl until smooth; stream into bowl with the paste, whisking continually to incorporate. Pour the dressing over the potato and onion mixture.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let salad cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
