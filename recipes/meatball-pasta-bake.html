    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This easy-to-make baked casserole is better than lasagna! </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package ziti pasta </li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds frozen cooked meatballs, thawed</li>
        <li>2 (28 ounce) jars prepared marinara sauce </li>
        <li>1 cup ricotta cheese </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning /li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder </li>
        <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided </li>
        <li>⅔ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti and cook, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes less than the package instructions, about 8 minutes. Drain pasta.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 13x9 inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook meatballs until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Add marinara sauce and ricotta cheese; mix to combine. Add cooked pasta and mix to combine. Season with Italian seasoning and garlic powder.</li>
        <li>Cover the bottom of the prepared baking dish with a layer of sauce without meatballs. Sprinkle 1 cup mozzarella cheese on top. Add another layer of sauce with meatballs on top and sprinkle with 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese. Add another layer of 1 cup mozzarella cheese. Add the rest of the sauce and meatball mixture on top, followed by remaining 1 cup mozzarella cheese and 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove foil and bake until cheese starts to turn golden brown, 10 to 20 minutes. Enjoy!</li>
